# Transition-based Parsing

In this final project, I developed bottom-up, top-down, and left-corner CFG (Context Free Grammars) parsers in Haskell using the transition-based parsing schemas that learned in
class.

### What is CFG?
> According to Google, "CFG parsing" refers to the process of analyzing a string of symbols to determine if it is valid according to a set of rules defined by a Context-Free Grammar (CFG), essentially breaking down the string into its grammatical components by applying the grammar's production rules to build a tree-like structure called a parse tree; this is commonly used in compiler design and natural language processing to check the syntax of a program or sentence respectively. 

Applications of CFG Parsing:
- Compiler design: Checking the syntax of programming language code by ensuring it adheres to the grammar rules defined for that language. 
- Natural Language Processing (NLP): Analyzing the grammatical structure of sentences to understand their meaning. 
- XML parsing: Validating the structure of XML documents based on their defined grammar.
